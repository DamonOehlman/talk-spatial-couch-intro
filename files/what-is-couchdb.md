# What is CouchDB?

---

## A NoSQL document store

- Data is stored as JSON fragments.
- Data can be collated and queried using views.
- I like to think of it as a distributed file system that actually works.
- And, it's also a webserver.

## Where Does CouchDB fit?

- I think the question is more, where doesn't it?

- Suitable for:

    - Small test applications
    - Websites
    - Distributed Data Stores
    - Use it as a Distributed File System that works.
