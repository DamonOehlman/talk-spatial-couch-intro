# Introduction to GeoCouch

GeoCouch is a spatial extension to CouchDB, and it's one of those pieces of technology that just feels right. Simple to get data in, simple to get data out while still providing access to some relatively powerful geospatial operations.

In this talk, Damon will provide an introduction to CouchDB and Geocouch and show some potential situations where it might be exactly the right tool for the job.
